			<p>My graduation project was done for the Maasstad hospital in Rotterdam. The assignment was to help non-allergy specialists to diagnose allergies correctly.  The Maasstad had already developed an algorithm that provides commentary text with blood test results for a better interpretation. However, it is still very important to find a possible cause of an allergic reaction for a test is done. Otherwise it will be nearly impossible to get conclusive results.
			I decided to put the focus on making a product that can be used by general practitioners, as these are the first doctors most patients see with their allergic symptoms.

			<p>To aid general practitioners and their patients in finding a possible cause, I designed the Allergenie; an app that helps the patient to easily keep track of their food intake and symptoms. The app can also be used to keep track of care products. When a general practitioner expects a patient might have an allergy, they can suggest to use the Allergenie app for a couple of days. 
			Normally, patients kept track of their food on paper, which is a hassle for both them and their doctor. The Allergenie app provides a barcode scan function to quickly add a product and register all ingredients. This way, also less obvious allergens are tracked.  Tracking is also a lot easier as people tend to always have their smart phone on them.

			<p>After a couple of days, the patient returns to their general practitioner. Before their consult, the patient can export their tracked data and e-mail it either directly to their doctor or to themselves to print out. This export provides a visual overview on what allergens the patient has come into contact with before their symptoms occurred. It also shows a list of allergens that are consumed often before symptoms occurred.

		<div class="ui seven wide column"><p>Since the patient can also already see in their app what they have eaten beforehand, the doctor and patient can together find a possible cause. A test can be ordered to provide a more decisive diagnosis.  Using the algorithm of the Maasstad hospital, the chances of mis-diagnosis will be mitigated a lot. The patient also has a lot more insights on which foods they will need to avoid.
