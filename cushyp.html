			<p>This project was done for the course "Exploring Interactions". The goal of this course was to dive into a certain context and develop a product that betters a certain interaction that happens within this context. By making small prototypes and doing design interventions, a product is developed.</p></div>

			<p>The final product I designed for this project is the Cushy. The Cushy is a neck pillow with a lot of small heating elements in it. The elements heat up alternately, creating a circular movement of heat around the users back and neck, simulating a hot stone massage. The circular movement and the heat relax the muscles in the back and neck, which in turn helps relax the mind. <br>

			<p>Since the assignment for this project was very broad, the starting topic was also very broad. At first I started observing the coffee drinking habbits of people. The focus was put on morning coffee, and the target group that was chosen was people arriving at their office jobs.
	        The topic of drinking coffee was let go, because altough it is an interesting direction to design for, it did not totally fit the expectations of this course. I zoomed out to giving people that arrive at work a moment for themselves to transition from feeling stressed and rushed to being ready for work. The interaction vision for this project was "like being underwater scubadiving".</p>

			<p>To find out what helps people transition from feeling stressed, many small design interventions were tested. People were given small assignments to help them relax, or to feel like they were in a metaphorical bubble, where they were able to do whatever helps them to relax, without being bothered by their surroundings.</p>
