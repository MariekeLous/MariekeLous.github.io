			Hi, my name is Marieke. 
			I am a student of Delft University of Technology, following the master Design for Interaction. Currently I am doing my graduation project for the Maasstad hospital, where I am designing an app to help general practitioners in diagnosing allergies. 
			I like designing digital products, and am teaching myself a bit of coding and front end development. 
			As a UX/UI designer I want to help people improve their lives by designing intuitive, digital products.
 			<br><br>
		    One of my goals in life is to make people happy. Over the years as a design student/UX designer, I noticed that most people are happy when they feel confident, safe and in control. Good UX addresses all these feelings. 
			Nothing makes me happier than knowing I took part in improving someone’s live, even if it is just a tiny part of it.
			Within my master I am doing a specialization called medisign, which focuses on designing for the medical field. This does not only include doctors and hospitals, but all types of patients and caregivers as well. I believe there is a lot to improve within healthcare, and design can play an important role in enhancing patient experience. I feel great empathy for people dealing with illness and injury, and the powerlessness they can feel when their body does not work as it is supposed to. Small design interventions can make an enormous impact, and that is why I love being a designer.

		    <p>It can be hard for general practitioners to diagnose an allergy. To aid in this process, the Maasstad hospital developed an algorithm that gives interpretation texts with the results. It it is however still important that a possible cause is found for tests are done. To help a find this possible cause, the allergenie app is developed. This app helps patients to keep track of their food intake and symptoms, and helps the GP link symptoms to allergens.

		    <p>Respberry and Rapp are developed for Teva Pharma as a means to increase therapy loyalty in teenage and young adult asthma patients. The Respberry is a device they can click onto an inhaler and guides inhalation. It can also be used to take note of encounters with stimuli or symptoms. The Rapp is an app that provides the users with visual feedback on their inhalation habbits, and allows them to keep track of stimuli and symptoms.

		    <p>Cushy is a neck pillow with heating elements, designed to help people that arrive at work feeling stressed or rushed to quickly relax before they start their work day. The heat moves around the user's back and neck to help them relax their muscles, which in turn helps to relax their mind. The Cushy can be used in many different ways, to fit a broad range of user's needs.</p>

		    <p class="hidden content fitted">One of the main projects in my master is to redesign an existing product and improve its usability and user friendlyness. To do so, user tests need to be conducted to find the errors in the current product and to test the redesigns to see if the product now has better usability. The product in question was a body composition monitor; a scale that measures weight, fat percentage, water percentage, muscle mass and much more. </p>

		    <p>The Noun Project is a place where designers can upload their icons and users can search for icons to match their needs. Anyone can upload their designs, but they have to meet certain criteria to be able to be approved for the site. For example, all icons must be made using only the color black. Since I like to make icons, this is a great website for me to share my work with the rest of the world.
