			<p>This project was done for the course "Joint Master Project", where students of the different masters work together on one project. The assignments are given by a real company. Our assignment was done for Teva Pharma, a large pharmaceutical company.
			The goal of this project was to increase therapy loyalty in asthma patients. We chose to focus only on teenagers and young adults with asthma, as the problem of therapy disloyalty is the largest in this age group. <br>
			Project done by: Sally Augustijn, Eduard de Jong, Marieke Lous and Jette Mul</p>

		<div class="ui seven wide column"><p>To achieve the goal of enhancing therapy loyalty, visual feedback is very important. The final design of this project consisted of two parts that both provided visual feedback; one part was the Rapp, an app that provides the users with visual feedback on their inhalation habbits. The app also provides the user with the opportunity to keep track of the stimuli they encounter and the symptoms they experience. <br> </p></div>
		<div class="ui seven wide column"><p>The other part of the design was the Respberry, a small device that can be put on top of their inhaler to guide them during inhalation. It is important that the angle of the inhaler is correct, so the medication reaches deep into the lungs. The Respberry can also be used to take note of stimuli or symptoms in case the user cannot use their phone. <br>
            Clickable mockups of the interfaces can be found <a href="https://invis.io/DM7GF0JXB">here for the app</a> and <a href="https://invis.io/C57JX2PWJ">here for the device.</a></p></div>

			<p> This project was divided in three phases: <br>
            During the first phase, the whole group did an analysis of the current situation. This was done by literature study, reviewing existing products, interviewing an pulmonologist, and interviewing asthma patients. <br>
            This information was clustered and structured to be able to get an overview of how people currently deal with their asthma. <br>
            Since one conclusion was that there are many differences between different demographic groups, we decided to only focus on teenagers and young adults. </p>

    	  <p>The second phase was ideation. We started out by brainstorming for ideas. <br> 
            A codesign session was conducted to get insights from out target group. 
            All the ideas were combined into three concepts. As a student from Design for Interaction, I made sure that the concepts would be user friendly and easy to use. <br>
            Two out of three concepts worked with interfaces.  I made simple mock-ups of these interfaces to communicate to the company what these would look like and how they would work.</p>
